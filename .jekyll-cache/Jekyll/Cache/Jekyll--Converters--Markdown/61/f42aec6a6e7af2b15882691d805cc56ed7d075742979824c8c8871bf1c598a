<p>The LiM Carrier Board series is a series of minimalistic Raspberry Pi (RPi) Compute Module 4 (CM4) Carrier Boards. Less-is-More (LiM) refers to the minimalistic design only providing the most rudimentary functionality to the CM4 such as 5V power via USB-C power connector and two status (power/activity) LEDs for the original LiM Carrier Board version. Additional + versions of the LiM Carrier Board will/might feature additional functionality such as flashing capability and SD card slot (see conceptual table below).</p>

<p>This is meant for CM4 boards with onboard storage (a future LiM version might sport a SD card slot for CM4 Lite modules) and wifi as this carrier board provides no other functionalty other than power and status LEDs.</p>

<p>The first version of the LiM Carrier Board has been prototyped and more information can be found <a href="pages/LiM_Board.html">here</a>. The second version, the LiM+ Carrier Board has also been prototyped, more info can be found <a href="pages/LiM+_Board.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>The LiM carrier board took about two months from idea (May 22nd, 2021) to delivery (July 14th, 2021). Special thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anish-verma-a5a05a8b/" target="_blank">Anish Verma</a> for working with me on the CAD designs of the carrier board.</p>

<p>The idea for such a minimalistic board was born from a conversation with <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/" target="_blank">Jeff Geerling</a> when I asked him if he knew of a more minimalistic design than <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/dronecz/minimal-carrier-board-for-compute-module-4/" target="_blank">this board</a>? He pointed me to to uptime.lab’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CPGakesLwBo/" target="_blank">Upberry</a>.</p>

<p>Neither of these boards are exactly what I was looking for for my use case. So insipired by Jeff I decided to design my own, customized board to my specs and that’s how the Less-is-More board came to be.</p>

<p>I forked this board design from <a href="https://github.com/ShawnHymel/rpi-cm4-base-carrier" target="_blank">Shawn Hymel</a>. He has a two part youtube series where he goes through how to design a CM4 Carrier Board.</p>

<p>Feel free to modify this design for your own application.</p>

<p>Other iterations of the LiM board, inlcuding SD card tray and flashing capability are in the conceptual or prototype stages.</p>

<p>Here is the current conceptual list of planned boards:</p>
